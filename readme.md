# Minecraft Mod C++

This project serves as a proof of concept for c++ minecraft mods. 

## Requirements

- minecraft `1.19.4`
- fabric mod loader
- [java 17 runtime](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17&os=windows&arch=x64&package=jdk) (anything that isn't using a custom JVM should work)

## Tools

- [mapping viewer](https://wagyourtail.xyz/Projects/MinecraftMappingViewer/App), very useful for converting mapped functions/classes into their obfuscated counterparts
